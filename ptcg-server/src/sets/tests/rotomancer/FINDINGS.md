# Cross-engine findings — Rotomancer IR vs native Twinleaf

Discrepancies surfaced by the corpus replay (`rotomancer-corpus.spec.ts`) over the 78
pure-const-damage attacks in Rotomancer's IR snapshot. Adjudication (which project to fix)
is intentionally **deferred** — this is the measurement, recorded as it was found. Each is
allow-listed in the spec so the suite stays green and *new* disagreements still fail.

Scorecard (snapshot 2026-05-17): **19 agree · 1 disagree · 4 error · 54 skip**
(skip = 29 unmapped `me*` + 25 number-drift / not-in-Twinleaf).

| printing | attack | finding | likely owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| sv8-105 | Vibrava — "Cutting Wind" | Twinleaf names the attack **"Cutter Wind"**; IR (and the real card) use **"Cutting Wind"**. | **Twinleaf** (data typo) |
| sv8-137 | Turtonator — Steaming Stomp | Cost type differs: Twinleaf **Fire**, IR **Fighting**. Turtonator is a fire attacker, so the IR cost looks wrong. | **Rotomancer** (IR cost) |
| sv6pt5-5 | Decidueye — Power Shot | IR encodes a flat **170**; the real attack is *"discard a Grass Energy from your hand; if you do, 170, else nothing."* Twinleaf implements the rider. | **Rotomancer** (IR faithfulness) |
| sv10-82 | T.R.'s Wobbuffet — Headbutt Bounce | Twinleaf printing has no attack by that name (`UNKNOWN_ATTACK`). Needs printing/name check. | investigate |
| sv5-136 | Minccino — Beat | Twinleaf's Beat throws `CANNOT_PLAY_THIS_CARD` when used. | **Twinleaf** (attack wiring) |

### Additional findings (interpreter / count work)

| printing | attack | finding | likely owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| sv6-122 | Aggron — Angry Slam | IR encodes `forEach pokemonInPlay` (all your Pokémon); the real attack (and Twinleaf) counts only Pokémon **with damage on them** — a `countOf` with a predicate flattened to a plain `forEach`. | **Rotomancer** (IR drops the predicate) |

Notes:
- "Owner" is a hypothesis from reading both sides, not a verdict. Confirm against
  `~/projects/pokemon-cards/docs/vendor/por_rulebook.md` + the card's printed text before
  changing either engine.
- The Decidueye case is partly a fixture limitation (the mirror has no Grass Energy in hand),
  but the IR also mis-classifies a conditional attack as pure damage — both are real.
- `skip` is not a finding: 29 `me*` are unmapped (deferred set-code map) and 25 are
  number-drift / absent printings that the resolver correctly refuses to substitute by name.
